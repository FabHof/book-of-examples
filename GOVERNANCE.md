# Governance

This project uses [Martha's Rules][marthas-rules] for making decisions.
The first section below describes these rules;
the second lists current voting members of the project and explains how to become one,
while the third lists decisions made to date.

## Making Decisions

1.  Before each voting deadline (discussed below),
    anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal by filing an issue in the GitHub repository tagged "governance"
    and either "propose-addition" or "propose-change".
    Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a voting deadline in order to be considered,
    and must include:
    -   a one-line summary as the subject line of the issue
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any relevant background information
    -   some discussion of pros and cons
    -   some discussion of plausible alternatives (if any)

2.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.
    The group may not discuss or vote on the issue
    unless the sponsor is able to respond to questions and comments during the discussion period.

4.  At or before the voting deadline,
    a sense vote is cast for the proposal.
    Each person may vote +1 (in favor), 0 (no opinion), or -1 (opposed).

5.  If all votes are +1 or 0,
    the proposal is accepted with no further discussion.

6.  If the majority of votes are -1,
    it is suspended pending further work by its sponsor
    (who may instead choose to withdraw it).

7.  If a minority of votes are -1,
    members have one calendar week to add comments to the issue in its GitHub Issues thread.
    At the end of this time a second vote is held
    in which all votes must be either +1 or -1.
    If a majority votes in favor the proposal is adopted.
    Otherwise, the proposal is rejected.

## Suffrage

1.  The following people are currently voting members of this project:
    -   Luke **Boswell**
    -   Richard **Feldman** (co-editor)
    -   Norbert **Hajagos**
    -   Stuart **Hinson**
    -   Greg **Wilson** (co-editor)
    -   Jasper **Woudenberg**

2.  To become a voting member, a person must:
    1.  select a topic in the issue list in this project's GitHub repository;
    2.  have their selection approved by the co-editors; *and*
    3.  submit a pull request creating a sub-directory for their topic with an `index.md` file.

3.  Once ten (10) people have qualified as members under rule #2,
    further additions will be made by:
    1.  filing a "governance" issue in the repository to propose the addition; and
    2.  allowing 72 hours for objections.
        If there are any objections,
	the addition will go through the procedure described in "Making Decisions" above.

4.  Voting members may resign from the project at any time.

5.  Voting members may lose their vote if a proposal to that effect is passed
    according to the procedure described in "Making Decisions" above.
    1.  A proposal to remove someone's vote may not contain any other business.
    2.  Each person must be the subject of a separate proposal.
    3.  The person in question has the right to vote on the proposal to remove them.

## Recording Decisions

Proposals that have been accepted are listed below in reverse chronological order.
Each entry contains:

1.  the date the proposal was accepted,
2.  the proposal's one-line summary, and
3.  a link to the proposal issue in GitHub.
