# Software Design by Example in Roc
2023-03-07

## The Road So Far

-   2004
    -   [Greg Wilson][wilson-greg] teaching a course on Software Architecture
    -   Frustrated by lack of descriptions of actual software systems
-   2007: [*Beautiful Code*][bc]
    -   Widely read (won a Jolt Award)
    -   But not useful as a textbook
        -   Topics ranged from very small to very (very) large
	-   Too many different languages
-   2011–12: [*The Architecture of Open Source Applications*][aosa]
    -   Still gets hundreds of visitors a day over a decade later
    -   But again, required too much background knowledge to be accessible to junior programmers
-   2022–23: *Software Design by Example* in [JavaScript][sdxjs] and [Python][sdxpy]
    -   Finally got it right
-   All royalties to charity (does some good and keeps accounting simple)
    -   Amnesty International
    -   Books for Africa
    -   Red Door Family Shelter
    -   Rainbow Railroad

## A Few Hard Truths

- Nobody makes money from technical books any more
- But authors of books can charge more as consultants
- It's a good way to give back to the community
- And it helps you see things through novice eyes once again

## Design Decisions

-   Scale models of tools that programmers use day-to-day
-   Accessible to undergraduates who have been programming for 2–3 years
-   Each topic teachable in an hour
    -   Which occasionally means finding a way to implement one logical topic as two pieces
-   Avoid language idiosyncrasies
    -   Focus on design principles, not clever tricks
    -   In retrospect, should have used Lua rather than JavaScript or Python…
-   Diagrams and exercises so that readers can check their understanding

## The Python Version

| Objects as dictionaries       | Object persistence |
| Parsing regular expressions   | A build manager    |
| Executing regular expressions | FTP                |
| Hash-based file archiver      | An HTTP server     |
| A unit testing framework      | A text editor…     |
| HTML template expander        | …with undo/redo    |
| Page layout                   | A debugger         |

## Publication

-   Taylor & Francis will let us keep the full text online forever
    -   They own print, PDF, and epub
-   15–25 sections
-   Greg volunteers to wrangle the LaTeX
-   And we'll need to teach it at least once
    -   Because no lesson survives first contact wtih its learner

## A Few Suggestions

-   Read, then write
-   Don't try to be funny or surprised
-   Avoid banal advice
-   Don't pretend to explain the basics
-   Don't try to compete with the web
-   Drywall, then paint
-   Automate, but proof-read
-   *Tell a story*

## It Will Be Fun
