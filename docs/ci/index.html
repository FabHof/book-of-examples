<ul>
  <li>What is a CI system?
[OPEN QUESTION] Is this section useful?
    <ul>
      <li>CI: scripts that run automatically when code is changed
        <ul>
          <li>To gate what gets merged into the project (automated tests)</li>
          <li>To automate common tasks (releases)</li>
          <li>Because the scripts run too slow on a regular computer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>CI system: software that runs these scripts.
        <ul>
          <li>Examples: Github Actions, Jenkins, …</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We’re going to design a CI system. Goals:
    <ul>
      <li>Allow CI scripts to be written in the Roc language</li>
      <li>CI steps can run in parallel to make CI complete faster</li>
      <li>CI can produce clear reports on (failed) runs</li>
      <li>CI script created this way can be ran by, for instance, Github Actions
        <ul>
          <li>Because Github Actions is free for open source projects, so commonly used</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We’re going to design the CI around an example project:
[OPEN QUESTION] seem reasonable to use a roc project as the CI example in a Roc book?
    <ul>
      <li>A Roc library, using git for version control</li>
      <li>CI runs tests and performs a release of the library if they pass:
        <ul>
          <li>Run tests in library code itself</li>
          <li>Checks for errors in example apps bundled with library</li>
          <li>Create a release bundle on Github</li>
          <li>Build documentation for library and push to static site
[OPEN QUESTION] github pages / Netlify / … ?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>[OPEN QUESTION] add a github-actions yml stub for automatically running this script on Github?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First iteration: a single script that performs the above tasks in order
    <ul>
      <li>Script written in Roc using the basic-cli platform</li>
      <li>Helper functions for different CI steps, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> calls the helpers in order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflect:
    <ul>
      <li>Nice: script can be ran locally and by CI server with equal ease (many CI systems don’t have this property)</li>
      <li>Not nice: output is a single logfile. Error presentation does not have a clear format like:
Step X failed, for reason Y</li>
      <li>Single script, no opportunities to run parts of it in parallel for faster CI</li>
      <li>Fails on first error, does not accumulate as much errors from parallel branches as possible</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Second iteration: Allow CI system to run steps in parallel on different machines
    <ul>
      <li>This requires the CI system to know the structure of the CI script before running it, specifically:
        <ul>
          <li>What steps does the script consist off?</li>
          <li>What are the dependencies between the steps
            <ul>
              <li>Important for figuring out running order, and what can be parallelized</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Additionally, if we’re going to run steps in different processes on different machines, when one step wishes to pass some data to a subsequent step, we need to serialize/deserialize that data.</li>
      <li>Propose design for a data type that contains the information the CI system needs to be able to orchestrate a parallelized build:
        <pre><code class="language-roc">Job : List Step

Step : {
    name : Str,      # assuming each step to have a unique name
    dependencies : List Str,
    run : List U8 -&gt; Task (List U8) Str,
}
</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Now for designing an API to construct values of the above type
        <ul>
          <li>Motivation: having to manually construct these values would be error prone (circular dependencies, missing dependencies), and unergonomic (serializing/deserializing each step)</li>
          <li>Design consideration: the API in our previous iteration was in many ways ideal: our ‘CI system’ was a plain Roc script, so no special knowledge was required to write CI. Let’s keep as close to this design as we can.</li>
          <li>In the spirit of the above, let’s not change anything about the functions we had implementing individual steps.</li>
          <li>We have to change our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> though. Present proposed design
            <pre><code class="language-roc">job : Ci.Job
job =
    repoDetails &lt;- Ci.step0 "setup git" Ci.setupGit

    testsPass &lt;- Ci.step1 "run tests" repoDetails
    docs &lt;- Ci.step1 "build documentation" repoDetails
    release &lt;- Ci.step1 "build release" repoDetails

    {} &lt;- Ci.step2 "publish release" testsPass release
    {} &lt;- Ci.step2 "publish documentation" testsPass docs

    Ci.done
</code></pre>
            <p>This looks reasonably similar to the main we had before. Instead of directly calling the step functions, we wrap the function calls into one of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ci.stepX</code> functions.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Show how we can implement the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ci</code> module to make the API above produce a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job</code> value.</li>
          <li>Show how we can implement code that runs a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job</code> value, still using the basic-cli platform.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflect:
    <ul>
      <li>Our CI now parallelizes steps when possible</li>
      <li>Our system executes as large a part of the step graph as it can instead of failing on the first error.</li>
      <li>We will be able to improve CI output, grouping it by step</li>
      <li>Within a step output could still be improved. Would be nice to see each individual command run, and then the stdout/stderr of that individual command below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third iteration: custom task type to control effects performed in task steps
[OPEN QUESTION] is this too much? Can be cut if so.
    <ul>
      <li>Currently CI scripts can make use of any Task-returning function supported by the basic-cli platform. If we define our own Task type then we can limit effects ran to functions that we provide, and then ensure those functions format output in particular ways.</li>
      <li>Show implementation of a custom Task type that wraps the platform’s Task type, implement basics of Task API.</li>
      <li>Implement library functions for printing a line to stdout and one for running a command.</li>
      <li>Update example to use the new helpers</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reflect:
    <ul>
      <li>We can now fully customize presentation of tasks run by the script.</li>
      <li>Downside is that users of the CI system will no longer be able to rely on their familiarity with the Tasks provided by the basic-cli platform. That seems okay though, having environments supporting different types of effectfull function is a core tenet of the Roc language.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ideas for further iterations:
    <ul>
      <li>Turn CI system from a library into a platform
        <ul>
          <li>Get benefits of controlling effects without needing a custom Task type</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Produce pipeline specifications for other CI systems (like Github Actions) from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Job</code> values.
        <ul>
          <li>Makes it possible to use Roc-ci specifications in many commonly used (sometimes free) CI systems.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
