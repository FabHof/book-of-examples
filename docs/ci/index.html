<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Start with designing some of the APIs, using types to test/communicate ideas</li>
  <li>Implementation following the ‘scoping of CI system’ section below
I’d like to avoid platforms as much as possible in this section</li>
  <li>End with packaging the work up using a Roc platform</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="platforms-in-this-chapter">Platforms in this chapter</h2>

<p>The real system I hope to evolve this into will be a Roc platform for CI systems, and I think it could be a nice example of why platforms are a cool idea.
Roc platforms are not themselves written in Roc, so the work building the platform is not suitable material for this book.</p>

<p>I plan to use the basic-cli platform to get running code at the end of the chapter.
That will amount to “add a platform to turn Roc into something actually usable”, which doesn’t communicate why platforms are useful.
For that reason I think it makes sense to avoid focusing on platforms in this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="scoping-of-the-ci-system-created-in-the-chapter">Scoping of the CI system created in the chapter</h2>

<p>🔭 out of scope for this chapter
✂️ opportunities to cut scope further</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create an API for writing CI jobs in Roc, consisting of multiple CI steps
    <ul>
      <li>Steps can define inputs and outputs</li>
      <li>Steps can take outputs from other steps, introducing an order dependency</li>
      <li>Steps can run system commands
🔭 Designing Roc-wrappers for tools commonly used in CI (git/go/rspec/..)</li>
      <li>✂️ Steps run in an environment
🔭 Defining environments in other ways than through a Dockerfile</li>
      <li>🔭 Caching</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function that takes a step, it’s inputs, and runs it
    <ul>
      <li>Capture data about each step
        <ul>
          <li>stdout and stderr</li>
          <li>inputs and ouputs of step</li>
          <li>start/end times of step
🔭 capturing more fine-grained timings, such as of commands ran in steps</li>
          <li>success or failure</li>
          <li>🔭 capturing test output in a structured format</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implement functionality for scheduling and running jobs
    <ul>
      <li>Taking in requests to run jobs and queue them
✂️ Deduplicating requests to run the same job with the same inputs in the queue</li>
      <li>Running a job, by running it’s steps in dependency order</li>
      <li>Design for allowing work to be distributed across a cluster of CI workers
🔭 Implementation of clustering is out of scope</li>
      <li>🔭 support for pull-based jobs (i.e. Github events)</li>
      <li>🔭 running jobs in parallel</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>✂️ Some form of human interface for querying CI system progress
For a real system I’d like this to be a web UI, for the chapter I wonder if a CLI is good enough, or even to punt on this entirely.</li>
