      <h1>Governance</h1>



<p>This project uses <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/088610998600100206">Martha’s Rules</a> for making decisions.
The first section below describes these rules;
the second lists current voting members of the project and explains how to become one,
while the third lists decisions made to date.</p>

<h2 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Before each voting deadline (discussed below),
any voting members may sponsor a proposal
by filing an issue in the GitHub repository tagged “governance”
and either “propose-addition” or “propose-change”.
Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a voting deadline in order to be considered,
and must include:
    <ul>
      <li>a one-line summary as the subject line of the issue</li>
      <li>the full text of the proposal</li>
      <li>any relevant background information</li>
      <li>some discussion of pros and cons</li>
      <li>some discussion of plausible alternatives (if any)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.
The group may not discuss or vote on the issue
unless the sponsor is able to respond to questions and comments during the discussion period.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At or before the voting deadline,
a sense vote is cast for the proposal.
Each person may vote +1 (in favor), 0 (no opinion), or -1 (opposed)
by adding a comment to the GitHub issue.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If all votes are +1 or 0,
the proposal is accepted with no further discussion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the majority of votes are -1,
it is suspended pending further work by its sponsor
(who may instead choose to withdraw it).</p>
  </li>
  <li>If a minority of votes are -1,
members have one calendar week to add comments to the issue in its GitHub Issues thread.
At the end of this time a second vote is held
(again, by adding comments to the GitHub issue)
in which all votes must be either +1 or -1.
If a majority votes in favor the proposal is adopted.
Otherwise, the proposal is rejected.</li>
</ol>

  <li>
    <p>Voting members may resign from the project at any time.</p>

  <li>Voting members may lose their vote if a proposal to that effect is passed
according to the procedure described in “Making Decisions” above.
    <ol>

      <li>Each person must be the subject of a separate proposal.</li>
